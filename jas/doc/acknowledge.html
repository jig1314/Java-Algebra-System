<p>
Since 2008 the development of the API design and the Jython scripting interface 
was done in cooperation with 
<a href="mailto:raphael.jolly at free.fr">Raphael Jolly</a>.
Our joint developments have also been incorporated in a successor "ScAS" 
of his system 
<a href="http://jscl-meditor.sourceforge.net/" target="rela">jscl-meditor</a>.

<p>
The development of JAS would not have been possible without various
discussions with our colleagues, their constant support and their
encouragement of our work.  In particular we are indebted to Thomas
Becker, Wolfgang K. Seiler, Thomas Sturm, Axel Kramer, Youssef
Elbarbary, Jaime Gutierrez, Sherm Ostrowsky, Ted Kosan, Yosuke Sato,
Peter Horn, Dongming Wang and Georg Thimm for various discussions on
the design of and the requirements of typed object oriented computer
algebra software.
