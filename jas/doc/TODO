List of things to be resolved or accomplished:

issues to consider:

- implement Berlekamp-Zassenhaus for modular factorization

- implement IDEALDIV2 with extGB

- implement Musers multivariate factorization, evtl. with sparse Hensel lifting

- implement real roots with other methods, e.g. after Uspensky or Rolle

- implement complex roots with other methods, e.g. after Collins and Krandick

- implement involutive bases computation

- implement univariate power series composition and power

- make polynomial chinese remainder generic (?)

- check / test caching results of gcd computation

- algebraic number theory

- algebraic topology

- group theory, permutation groups

- use further util.concurrent algorithms where possible, e.g. in DHT

- remove unnecessary @see since JavaDoc 7 

- implement matrices to vector

- refactor from BasicLinAlg to GenMatrix and GenVector 

- implement Boolean with RingElem interface (?)

- refactor method names for groovy operator overloading, make examples for usage

- use Maven/Gradle/Buildr configuration management, Ivy done



partially resolved and completed issues:

- rework parallel GB algorithms

- rework distributed parallel GB algorithms

- parallel modular algorithms

- check solvable polynomials with integral domain coefficients

- implement quaternion integers for non-commutative coefficients

- implement other term orders for multivariate power series

- implement multivariate Hensel lifting for multivariate polynomial factorization

- implement 0-dim ideal complex root selection

- implement absolute polynomial factorization

- implement univaiate and multivariate polynomial factorization

- implement signature based GB computation, only iterative done

- implement Word ideal intersection, if possible

- provide all Jython examples also for JRuby

- provide a Sage Python like interface in Jython

- implement parallel proxys for GB computation

- refactor BigDecimal to RingElem and RingFactory, precision is now variable via context

- check the 693 exceptions (including 473 runtime exceptions) that are thrown, 
  reduce number of runtime exceptions

- check for safe publication in constructors, check wrt. the (new) Java memory model

- check and fix Findbugs warnings

- make use of gcd in pseudo reduction, needs other coefficient type

- add product category to applications

- implement direct products of ring elements

- define FieldElem and Field factory interfaces and use them for GB coefficients

- refactor Hensel lifting to ufd package, not possible because of 
  coefficient replacement trick
  !must be done some how!

- check correct term order in recursive algorithms,
  in GCD ModEval only univariate cases are used, so term order is not a problem
  in polynomial factorization we force / convert to invlex term order

- add assertions to check for number of polynomial variables and term order,
  nvar in GenPolynomial and GenSolvablePolynomial, done

- define quotientRemainder in MonoidElem interface with default implementation, done

- make final variables public (?)

- make hashCode to reuse computed value --> not immutable

- add method bitLength() to Element

- completely switch from svn to git

- remove @usage doc tag

  done in GenPolynomialRing, 
  undone in 2020 to avoid memory waste

- add missing comments in edu.jas.Algebra*, done

- let inverse() throw a runtime exception, done; throw a checked exception (?, no)

- refactor Power with Java 8 features, use lambdas and default implementations, done
